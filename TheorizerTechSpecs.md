Technical Specifications for Theorizer MVP:

1. A ruby on rails backend with authentication for users using the A/a authentication paradigm, built in the style of A/a.
    1. An auth endpoint for authenticating a user. /session and /users
    3. An endpoint for serving the static files. /home
    4. An CRUD endpoint for logging queries. (Two schema options, a separate table for queries, and a foreign key for the user, probably better so we can store dates).  /query
2. A ML service - API hosted separately /analysis - This can also his the auth endpoint to authenticate a request, and pass it as an orchestrator. But I feel like there's a better way to do it. 
    1. Build the ML Model and run it locally, probably in python with flask. 
        1. Run a small server with one endpoint, and then when the endpoint is hit, authenticate the request and then make the analysis.
        2. Cache the analysis and also cache the session tokens last used - Could I do a performance test with this and measure the results, using a cache and not using a cache for this section?
            1. Make 1000 requests and measure the time using the caches, and not using them (no cache, just auth cache, and just request cache, and then both), and see the time, and report the results, that would be interesting.
    2. Put the ML API on a cloud server and host the API endpoint.
    3. Authenticate it so that only an authorized user can make the request, and when the request is made, the api sends a message to the app to store a query count. 
        1. The session token cookie has to be passed to the ML api endpoint, and the ML service has to pull the session token from it. 
        2. Encryption of the cookie? 
    4. ML endpoint can store an LRU cache of the last five recently used session tokens. 
3. A frontend served from the RoR instance:
    1. Do I use React or Web components or straight vanilla javascript? That depends. I will definitely be bundling, but I want it to work on all browsers (IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox). Will have to test it. 
        1. Pros: React - industry standard right now, 
        2. Web Components: the future.
        3. Vanilla: I can just do it the way I want with no extra stuff, and have it be backward compatible, and if I use vanilla, what style should I use? God, there is too much to do here. 
    2. An authentication page to log in or sign up. 
    3. An homepage with a piano and music staff, on which you can add notes. 
    4. The staff and piano are linked together, so when I click a note, it gets added to the staff and vice versa. Perhaps this is possible only to a certain extent.
    5. Mobile-first: what does this mean? 
        1. The piano scales accordingly: how will I do this? At full screen the piano is a full width, and at certain widths the piano stops scaling and becomes scrollable, and then disappears.
            1. Phone 214px?: only staff. 
            2. Ipad 760px, scrollable piano.
            3. Large ipad: 900 px scrollable
            4. Screen 1200px: full piano.
        2.  Should the piano key change size? No, they should take up a definitive amount of space, because piano keys don’t change size, or maybe have two sizes. 
    6. Then an ‘analyze button’.
    7. Design will be similar to the current one. 
4. Tests for all aspects of the project and some kind of test analyzer that shows the whole thing is tested. Use what David Boldow is using. 
5. Set up a CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins for both the service and the web app equivalent to what I did at WSI, so I can test it using automate test scripting, and deploy from GitHub branches to the server. This will be all on AWS or something similar I guess. 

TDD:

Tests suites for controller functions:
	- When I look up a user, the query will return a ORM object that includes the user and the number of queries they have made, and their session token, and their password hash.
	- When I add user, I must include a username, and a password in their entries.
	- When I add a user, the number of queries made is set to zero. 
	- When I authenticate a user successfully, the return value will be the session token.
	- When I logout a user, a request must be sent to the ML service to remove that session token from the cache. 
	- When I fail to authenticate a user with username and password, an error will be returned. 
	- When a query is stored, it stores the correct date, and increments total number of queries for that user by one (tests the functionality of the table). 
Tests for Routes:
	- When I make a request to add a user, it should work when valid and fail when invalid payload.
	- When I request a session token, it should work when valid and fail when invalid. 
	- When I record a query same. 
	- When I request the home page, I should get the login page when user is not authenticated, and the homepage, when user is authenticated.
Tests for the ML service functions:
	- When I make the request, the first thing the service will do is authenticate the user. 
	- When I pass a valid session token the service will call the analysis function. 
	- When I pass an invalid token the service will throw an error. 
	- When the analysis function is called, the function will first check the cache before making a query.
	- After a period of a few minutes, a session token must be removed from the cache for security purposes.
	- When the analysis function is called, and the cache does not store the query, it will make an analysis.
	- When the analysis is made, it should work correctly (make twenty tests perhaps.)
ML Service Routes:
	- When I make the call with correct credentials, the request should succeed, and fail when the credentials are invalid (invalid payload or invalid credentials).
Tests for the frontend functions:
	- Requests: When I make a request to the ML service, it should include a payload that is valid and also the session information. 
	- Requests: When I make a request for authentication, it should include both the username and password of the user as the payload.
	- When the page loads, there should be three major sections: the staff, the keyboard, and the analysis section (visual test).
	- Tests for the keyboard: the keyboard should have 88 keys, and each one should work (one click for selection, one click for de-selection).
	- Refresh the page and whatever was selected should load back up (store configuration in local storage or similar). 
	- Clicking on the analyze button should initialize an API request. 


Technical considerations for Theorizer Security and Monetization.

How to secure the ML Framework - if it’s authenticated, then the API can be UI agnostic, which would be great.
	One way - check the database for valid auth token, then perform analysis if valid, charge user when analysis confirmed (will require API calls.)
				- Why distinguish between an auth token and a session token? Read the twitter or some other authenticated API.
		- Hackable - someone gets your session token, then other users could use your session token (set expiry and encrypt it).
		- ML framework needs to make request (one for validity, another for charging account after successful request).
	Another way - enforce IP address, but still need to send user information.

Backend - can scale as a series of micro-services or monolith? Options (Django, rails node, spring, rack, other?, probably tons), and guard against all of the major security vulnerabilities.
	Auth - Verifies users, creates a new users, issues valid session tokens for logged in users.
	Financial Information - Charges a user account when an analysis made.
	Get songs - CRUD for songs - stores song name, pdf or other image file, and other categorical information.
	Database - probably relational - secure the database too, only the server can access the database. - how to secure financial information.
	Additional SQL and software for handling charges.

Frontend - Implements UI,
		- Need an keyboard, a musical score annotation mechanism, and a way to receive midi input.
		- Needs to authenticate users.
Backend - store user, financial information and records, and song list, potentially a history of analyses or state of annotation, implements the middleware and API.
ML Framework - needs to be easily interchangeable, updatable, perhaps learning from analyses made., needs to be secure, potentially scalable. 
			- security strategies: authenticate with a session token (how will the ML know which tokens are valid - a database call?) 
			- not authenticate but allows hits only from an IP (IP spoofing is possible).

MVP Technical Considerations:

	Build a better AI - do chord classification, but use a TRIE instead. Three notes makes a chord, all chords, and all inversions, but how to handle all chord cases, and slightly atypical (like C1,  and three E’s and a G), a trie is too smaller, especially when considering repeated notes. This is the justification for a neural network.
	How many major chords are there if we count repeated notes as possible and at least three notes, just one chord A minor, in the root possible with at least three notes played, can be played in 2^20 different configurations, multiply that roughly times twelve and then times two * three to get all possible configurations for major and minor chords in all inversions approx. 50 million different configurations - a trei is perhaps not useful here, or maybe it is. I could generate the dataset and see what happens, a dataset of 50 millions chord configurations and see what the neural network comes up with.
	Build a better backend - decouple the AI from backend, create a service. Implement session authentication, store user information, use something besides Django.
	Build a simpler frontend - use vanilla JS, keep the iframe for now - polypill and test all the major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, EI, EDGE).

Market Research Considerations: 

Google and Youtube Searches - How many piano performance videos show people readying sheet music, and how many don’t. What is the demand for piano lessons, and then simply personal experience and others.
