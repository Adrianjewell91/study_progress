Today I studied 
  1.  Contest versus Scope: 
  
  Context is object dependent, while scope is function dependent. For example, this.variable is calling a variable in the context of a specific object (which could be the window). Scope determines what variables a function can access (which can vary depending on the kind of function defined in Javascript.)
  
  2. What is the event loop?
  
  The event loop allows Javascript to make asynchronous calls. When an async call is made, it is processed in a separate thread, and only when it returns is it placed in to the queue to be processed.
  
  3. Bind vs Call vs Apply? 
  
  All three are ways of binding the context of the function so that it can be called in another context. Using Bind returns a new function that can be called with the arguments requiredd by the bound function. Call and Apply return the function immediately within the context described, the difference is in how arguments are passed. Call uses splat and Apply uses an array. 
  
  4. Binary Search Trees and QuickSort in O(n) space.
