The Python language works in a few ways I didn't know before. CPython, for instance, converts pthon into python bytecode, which then is cross compatible in the same way Java makes it code cross-compatible.

Additionally, the concept of immutable types is interesting. Primitive types can't be mutated, 
so if the variable is rebound, it gets a new memory address, and the previous gets
garbage collected. I wonder if this works the same way in other languages.
